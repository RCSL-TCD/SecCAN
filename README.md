# SecCAN
This repository comprises of the hardware implementation of a secure CAN controller with and IDS integrated into it with the ability to flag messages for the receive ECU. This implementation extends the existing open-source CAN controller implementation in verilog. The IDS is integrated into the bsp module of the controller and has the ability to pad each message with a flag bit for attack detection. The controller integrated a 4-bit quantised MLP as the IDS is a binary classifier which is trained to detect DoS/Flooding, Fuzzing and malfunction attacks trained on the open car hacking and survival analysis datasets. The hardware IP of the quantised IDS is built using the open-source FINN toolchain while the model is trained using the open-source quantisation aware training libray brevitas both from AMD Research Labs.
